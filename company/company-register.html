          <li>The LLP is a separate legal entity, is liable to the full extent of its assets but liability of the partners is limited to their agreed contribution in the LLP. In LLP individual partners are shielded from joint liability created by another partner’s wrongful business decisions or misconduct, Further, no partner is liable on account of the independent or un-authorized actions of other partners.</li>
          <li>Mutual rights and duties of the partners within a LLP are governed by an agreement between the partners or between the partners and the LLP as the case may be. The LLP, however, is not relieved of the liability for its other obligations as a separate entity, LLP is called a hybrid between a company and a partnership, Since LLP contains elements of both ‘a corporate structure’ as well as ‘a partnership firm structure'.
